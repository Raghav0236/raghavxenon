  <h3>SHOR</h3>
  <div class="detail">“Zindagi ek naatakh ai, aur humaare kayi kirdaar hain”</div>
<p class="dip">
    SHOR is emerged out of the combination of two theatre groups in UIET:
    Swastik and Natyashaala.
    The two theatre groups were well famed in their own fields of bubbling energy, well written scripts including fresh ideas with some amazing music composers on the nukkad ground.
    They then combined the two different groups to include every little perfection in the new club then formed, named SHOR. 
    The objective of Club SHOR is to help the young students of PUSSGRC to express themselves in the form of Dramatics. The club helps street theatre enthusiasts to showcase and develop their acting, writing and directional skills.
    
    Along with acting the club also focuses to make the members sing, dance and exercise together by having daily morning singing and fitness sessions together to keep the team spirit alive.
